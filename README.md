# Image_Processing_Program
Program description: This program includes various image processing functions such as histogram equalization, Sobel edge detection, custom threshold, smoothing filter, etc., and uses the relevant knowledge learned in the image process course to write image processing functions in C#, and Design graphical user interface(GUI).

## Related Image Processing Functions
* **RGB Extraction & Transformation:**<br> Extract the R, G, B channel from the color image and transform it to gray scale image.
* **Smooth filter:**<br> Design a smoothing filter with a filter size of 4 using a median filter and an average filter.
* **Histogram Equalization:**<br> Implement histogram equalization and display histogram of image before and after processing.
* **A user-defined thresholding:**<br> Given a threshold t. The intensity of a pixel which is higher than or equal to t will be set as white (255), otherwise set as black (0).
* **Sobel edge detection**<br> Design SOBEL edge detector using vertical, horizontal, and combined three different masks<br>
